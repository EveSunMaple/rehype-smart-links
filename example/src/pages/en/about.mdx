# About rehype-smart-links

rehype-smart-links is a rehype plugin designed to enhance links in Markdown documents. It adds smart navigation and styling features to help users distinguish between different types of links, improving the document reading experience.

## Features

### 1. Smart Link Classification

The plugin automatically detects and categorizes links into three types:

- **Internal Links** - Links pointing to pages within your website
- **External Links** - Links pointing to other websites
- **Broken Links** - Links pointing to non-existent pages

### 2. Class Names and Attribute Addition

The plugin adds specific class names and attributes to different types of links:

```html
<!-- Internal link -->
<a href="/about" class="internal-link">About Page</a>

<!-- External link -->
<a href="https://example.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example Website</a>

<!-- Broken link -->
<a href="/non-existent" class="broken-link">Non-existent Page</a>
```

The plugin provides a rich set of customization options that allow you to adjust link handling behavior according to your needs:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `internalLinkClass` | `string` | `'internal-link'` | Class name for internal links |

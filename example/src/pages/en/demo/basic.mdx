# Basic Functionality Demo

This page demonstrates the basic functionality of rehype-smart-links. You can see how different types of links are processed and styled.

## Internal Links

Internal links are automatically recognized and styled accordingly. For example:

- [Home](/en) - Link to the website homepage
- [About Page](/en/about) - Link to the about page
- [Non-existent Page](/en/this-page-does-not-exist) - Link to a page that doesn't exist (will be marked as a broken link)

## Broken Links

The plugin automatically detects and marks links to non-existent pages:

- [Broken Link Example](/en/broken-link-example) - This page doesn't exist
- [Another Broken Link](/en/another-broken-link) - This page doesn't exist either

## External Links

External links automatically get appropriate attributes, including `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`:

- [GitHub](https://github.com) - Link to GitHub
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - Link to MDN
- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build) - Link to Astro documentation

## Hover Effects

All link types have different hover effects to help users identify the type and status of links. Hover over the links above to see the effects.

## Configuration Example

To enable these features, simply add the following code to your configuration file:

```js
// Astro configuration example (astro.config.mjs)
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import rehypeSmartLinks from 'rehype-smart-links';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [[rehypeSmartLinks, {
      // Basic configuration options
      internalLinkClass: 'internal-link',
      brokenLinkClass: 'broken-link',
      externalLinkClass: 'external-link'
    }]]
  }
});
```
